<!--
  This template allows users without triage permissions to create an issue with labels listed above. It is not
  listed when creating a new issue on GitHub, because it doesn't have a template name.

  It's required for the "Report bug" button in Fluent UI v9 Storybook to work properly. Without this template,
  bugs reported by partners will not be properly labeled and the bug won't be shown in the Known Issues section.
